# ECU-Fault-Induction-Box
ECU Fault Induction Box 

This was a project that I was involved in during my time as an undergraduate electrical/software engineer at Jaguar Land Rover between summer 2018 to summer 2019. The purpose of the ECU fault induction box was to simulate a HVAC unit that would be present in a car, by simulating various faults and reading the ECU's outputs it is possible to determine whether the ECU is performing as expected. 

This box was controlled by an Arduino which was used to read and display on the LCD screen the voltages of 20 inputs to the ECU, these voltages could be adjusted using a potentiometer. It was also used to generate PWM signals of varying duty cycles and cycle through various screens showing the different inputs to the ECU.
